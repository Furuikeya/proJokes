When code gets tough and life goes tragic, just read a joke, it's f@%&ing magic!

Had a hard coding day? Feeling depressed and want to cheer up?
Here, have a joke! Just press a button and enjoy!

This app was created by [Furuikeya](https://github.com/Furuikeya) as an exercise solution while going through [Complete Web Developer in 2020: Zero-to-Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/) online web course by [Andrei Neagoie](https://zerotomastery.io/).

This is my first React app made from scratch, it is very simple and the code is far from ideal, but everything seems to be working as it should.
If you have any ideas how to make this app better, you are welcome to contribute. Just pull a request.

Thanx to [Sven 'sv443' Fehler](https://github.com/Sv443) for his great [JokeAPI](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/) that i used in this project. 

The Bitwise font which is created by [Digital Graphic Labs](http://www.digitalgraphiclabs.com/) was taken from [1001fonts.com](https://www.1001fonts.com/bitwise-font.html).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
