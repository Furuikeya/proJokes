When code gets tough and life goes tragic, just read a joke, it's f@%&ing magic!

This app was created by [furuikeya](https://github.com/Furuikeya) as an exercise solution while going through Zero-to-Mastery online web course by Andrei Neagoie.

Thanx to [Sven 'sv443' Fehler](https://github.com/Sv443) for his great [JokeAPI](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/) that i used in this project. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
